# To do
* Test multiple words in a single sentence. One word is chosen as before based on weight, and all words in that sentence that have a weight higher than that word will also be tested.
* Add statistics/progress page with scores such as "expected" word index from the word weight distribution, the word index with the biggest weight, plots of these over time, a histogram that can be zoomed and scrolled horizontally over weights ordered by word frequency, etc. 
* Improve error handling.
* Maybe find out a way to count the number of words the user has "learned" (gotten correct enough times? in a row?) and add that as a metric on the statistics page.
* Internationalize user interface.
* Maybe fetch definitions for words and incorporate them in some way.
* Add better support for right-to-left languages.
