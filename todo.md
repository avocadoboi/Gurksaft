# To do and ideas
* Add scores together with history graphs such as mean word index from the word weight distribution, the word index with the biggest weight etc. 
* Improve error handling. We should maybe implement a popup window for some error messages, for example if you are trying to download language data but you are not connected to the internet then we could show an error message in a new window, and after clicking 'retry' or 'cancel' we either immediately try again or go back to the previous screen. Maybe we should have the error message in the same window but on a dedicated page.
* Maybe find out a way to count the number of words the user has "learned" (gotten correct enough times? in a row?) and add that as a metric on the statistics page. 
* Add a slow listening button and a slowness parameter for this button in the options.
* Add an option for whether the audio should play automatically after each guess.
* Internationalize user interface.
* Maybe fetch definitions for words and incorporate them in some way. Use wiktionary and show definitions in the chosen translation languages when clicking on words?
* Add better support for right-to-left languages.
* Add progress bar to download screen.
