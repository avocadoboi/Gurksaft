# To do
This is a list of features I want to implement in the application.
* Add statistics/progress page with scores such as "expected" word index from the word weight distribution, the word index with the biggest weight, plots of these over time, a histogram that can be zoomed and scrolled horizontally over weights ordered by word frequency, etc. 
* Maybe find out a way to count the number of words the user has "learned" (gotten correct enough times? in a row?) and add that as a metric on the statistics page.
* Color the individual letters in the hint red or green after incorrect input based on matching with the correct word.
* Add a list of the 10 or something words with the biggest weights, either showing them on the statistics page, between tasks with a certain interval that can be set in the options, or both. Showing them between tasks with a certain interval could help give an overview of what words are most likely to come up. Maybe add some more information about the words in the list, a short example sentence or something.
* Add an audio button on the task page for sentences that have audio recordings on tatoeba. Since there might be multiple recordings for a single sentence, it should cycle between them or have a dropdown or something to choose the recording.
* Maybe fetch definitions for words and incorporate them in some way.
* Add better support for right-to-left languages.
