# Gurksaft
Gurksaft is an application meant to be used as an aid in learning the most useful vocabulary in a language. The words are selected based on [frequency](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords), and over time also a weighing that adapts to your learning. A sentence together with translations in your chosen language(s) is given with a word to fill in. The sentences are taken from the [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/en/) database.

This project is still in very early development, and is only a just-for-fun experiment. I'm welcome to any and all ideas, so feel free to create issues.

The backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) framework, and the frontend is written with [Angular](https://angular.io/).
